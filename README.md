# 5-SASS-project

Here is my 5th project. I've made this website by using SASS, HTML & CSS skills. Also I used BEM notation for class identifications. 
In this project, We have made this SASS project without backend side.
I learned how to shape website with HTML and CSS codes and how to link another pages and websites.


As an engineer, I was familiar with IT world but this step was one of my life changing step. 
I'm beginning to a journey which I'm planning to be a perfect Software Developer.
Let's move on...
